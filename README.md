# README
Pagify is a simple web component for pagifying content. At the moment it's pretty bare bones but it does what I need it to.

## Usage

## Development

1. Install dependencies

    npm install

2. Start watching the typescript files

    npm run dev

3. Serve the development folder, so you can access `test.html` in a browser

    npx serve .

4. Open `localhost:5000/test.html` to view the file.
